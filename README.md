# auto-hashtag
This was an attempt to create hashtags for photos uploaded to photostocks.
Currenty it only extracts a colors from photo, names them, and puts then into photo's exif

The second part of this project was to extract information about the contents of the picture aswell, using pre-trained NN. But it didn't work as well as i've expected, so i've ditched it.
